## Licensing

Things that go into Exherbo's official tree [must] [1] be licensed under
the GPLv2 license to be included in the tree. I don't like that license,
so I have dual-licensed the repository as both [GPLv2](LICENSE.GPLv2),
and [ISC](LICENSE.ISC).

For any intents involving Exherbo's tree, use GPLv2. For anything else,
take your pick.

ISC is probably what you want to use though, since it is more permissive.
